R_Experiment_DVA_Factor,DVA Factor,DVA,Float,0 … +R,"Determines the conversion to degrees visual angle. If not provided, plots etc. will use the raw X and Y data without units. If set to NaN, it is assumed the data is in unit 'pixels' and shall be represetned as such in plots, etc. If set to 1, it is assumed the data is already in degree visual angle. Any other values are considered a factor converting pixels to degree visual angle."
